<p>This is a test for the open source rendering engine WebWhirr.</p>

<p><b>WebWhirr is, right now, in a very early stage of development. In a very crude way, it reads two different tags in HTML: the "p" and "b" tags.</b></p>

<p>Here are a lot of words that I'm typing to test the new wrapping feature I just put in. Below is<img src="WebWhirr.png" alt="The logo that belongs to WebWhirr."> WebWhirr's logo.</p>

<p>At this point, you may be wondering: How does a rendering engine work? For an incredibly basic overview, let's look at it this way: As the document is parsed, objects called "nodes" are created. These nodes contain all of the information necessary to display a certain part of a web page. These nodes are then taken and linked together as a linked list. This list is passed to the painter, which takes the information in the nodes and displays the web page.</p>

<p>This is another line that is here to test nested tags like <b>the bold tag</b>. It demonstrates what happens when there is more than one <b>b</b> tag within a single node.</p>

<p>Eventually, WebWhirr will gain features like the ability to connect to the internet and access websites like:</p>

<p>So far, WebWhirr has been a great project. I'm excited to see where it develops.</p>
